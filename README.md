# Printing_Reservaion
## Overview:

This is a web-based Appointment Slot Booking System built using FastAPI (Python) for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It allows users to book appointment slots in various departments on selected dates. The system integrates with MongoDB to store reservation data and ensures users can only book from available time slots.

It is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making it easy for users to schedule appointments while preventing double bookings.

1. Slot Booking Interface

Users can input their name, select a subject, choose a department, pick a date, and select an available slot.

2. Slot Availability Logic

The system checks MongoDB for existing bookings and filters out booked slots.

5. Date Restrictions

Users can only select a date within a valid range (e.g., from today up to three weeks ahead).

Prevents booking outside the allowed timeframe.


6. FastAPI Backend

Handles all booking and slot-fetching logic through RESTful API endpoints.

Error handling and input validation are implemented for secure and robust functionality.


7. MongoDB Integration

Uses motor (async MongoDB driver) to interact with the database.

Stores reservation details efficiently with async operations.
